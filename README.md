## About

I'm an NMCT student at the Howest Kortrijk. I grew up from a small place called Wervik. I've always had a big interest in science and technology. I studied Chemical Engineering 1 year in Ghent, but noticed it was not my cup of tea. So I switched and learned how to program instead. The possibilities I had with programming really blew my mind, and with a thriving mobile development sector, I started creating my own apps to increase my knowledge about C#. In my second year I moved my focus to Backend programming with frameworks like ASP.NET. In the summer I discovered Arduino's and Raspberri Pi's, so started finding my way in the Maker community. In my final year of college I tried to look beyond the code, and picked up an interest for Information Security related topics. There I learned more about Linux systems. Recently I started experimenting a bit with the MS Bot Framework and playing with bots on media like Facebook and Slack.
